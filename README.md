# Jomari Designs - Code Institure 4th Milestone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chipchap31/freelancer-website.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/chipchap31/freelancer-website)

An E-commerece web application where business owner's can buy the affordable graphic designs.
Most of the times when you look for graphic designs such as logos, it can be a frustrating task. 
Especially, when you are having second thought on the final result.

With this web application users give as much information they want to fulfill their design needs and they can also request for 
unlimited changes on the concepts.

## UX Design

The UX process starts with learning the basic goals of both users and the site owner.
This can be done by listing user stories. Here are some of the most simple:

- As a visitor, I want to be able to see all of the previous graphic design projects. In order for me determine their quality.

- As a client, I want to be able to get a quote as well, so that I can buy another design.

- As an admin, I want to able to upload an image to provide a concept to the clients.


You can read more information about the stories by clicking [here](https://github.com/chipchap31/freelancer-website/blob/master/essentials/User%20Stories%20-%20Jomari%20Designs.pdf).


### Wireframing 

Wireframing is one of the important process of the design, as it helps the client, designers and developers be on the same page regarding the web application's structure.

I created the wireframe using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Please click [here](https://github.com/chipchap31/freelancer-website/blob/master/essentials/jomari-designs-wireframe.pdf) if you want to see them.

## Features
### Existing Features

- **Landing Page** - Contains a call out button at very top of the page (Nav bar) and also the header, as it is essential that visitors knows where to go next after loading the first page.

- **Quote Form** - Users has the ability to fill out the form which ask them for the project information and the deadline date. 

- **Login Form** - There are three forms altogether in this project. The first one is just a standard form that renders when the user clicks the client login button. The second form renders when the user wants to pay for a qoute but they already have an account already. The last one renders when the users access the payment page by typing the payment path in the browsers url.

- **Account Details Email** - New users reveives an email in order to obtain access to the platform.

- **Mobile Friendly** - All of the views adjusts and does not look distorted when switch between mobile views.
## Features left to implement

- **Password Recovery** - Using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/), I want to give the user the ability to recover their password, just in case they forgot their password. 
- **Request Changes Modification** - In the near future, I want to be able to give users the ability to edit their changes instead of just deleting.
- **User Rating** - In the future, I want the users to be able to add comments or rate on other projects.
- **Price Calculators** - In the future, I want to include color, width, and height as a factor that changes the price of the quote.

- **Email Signup** - In the future, I also want to include a functionality when the site owner does not want to take anymore client, users will have to leave email and wait for notification when the ownere is ready again.

### Libraries
I used several libraries but here are the main ones:


- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) 
    - A library that provides a clean an simple ui for Typescript and React users. I used to this library mainly for its Calendar module, as I need the users to pick a deadline date for each of their projects. Ant Design just makes that a lot easy for me.

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
    - An open-source Javascript module bundler. It is primarily for Javascript but I can also transform html, css and images. I used webpack so that I can transform JSX modules to a JS, less to css and also load images.

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) 
    - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
    - A JavaScript libray for building user interfaces. It is use in this project to reduce cognitive load.The quote form requires so much field to fill out and it might cause for users to become overwhelmed.

- [@stripe/react-stripe-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js)
    - An npm module that allows you to integrated stripe into any React application. I used this module in order to create a payment intent and also confirm it.
### Framework 

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
    - Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. I used Django to easily set up my data models and create urls with authentications.  

### Databases

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
    - Also known as Posgres, it is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensilbility and SQL compliance. I used this database because I have don't have a big data and it is easy to set up with Heroku.

- [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) 
    - I used sqlite for development and testing purposes.

### Tools
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Unit Testing 

In order to see if the most important feature of the application is working properly, I had to do some testing and this is can be done using travis.

I added a file called .travis.yml and added snippet below.

```javascript
language: python 
python: 
  - "3.8.1"

install: "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
env: 
  - SECRET_KEY='Test'
script: python manage.py test
```
 
So far, I was able to run 21 successful tests.

Note: This is for the examiner only and please refrain from uploading inappropriate images.

- Username: admin
- Password: testing_password

- As an admin, I want to be able to upload an image to a particular project to show the client the initial design.

    1. Click on the project models and choose any item on the list.
    2. Check the amount of concept requested by the user. For example if the concept_amount is equal to two, please upload to images.
    3. After uploading, check the finished checkbox to let the user know that you are finished designing the concept.
    4. Verify the upload is completed by going to media section of your Amazon S3 bucket. 

### Testing Bugs
There are numerous bugs I came accross while testing. For example:

- When a new order is created the new project is not added automatically. The fix this bug, I had to fetch all of the projects after payment.


## Deployment 

### Local Deployment

In order to run the project, install the following to your local machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) 

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

1. Open .bash_profile in the command line.

    ```python
    $ sudo nano .bash_profile
    ```
3. Save the following variables: 
    ```python
    export SECRET_KEY=<Your own secret key>
    export SENDGRID_KEY=<API key created from sendgrid>
    export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<Stripe secret key>
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret access key>
    export CLIENTS_EMAIL=<site owner's preferred email>
    ```

2. Open your command and move wherever you want to clone the repository and run the code below: 

    ```python
    $ git clone https://github.com/chipchap31/freelancer-website.git
    ```

3. Install the requirements. 
    ```python
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the server.
    ```python
    $ python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
5. Open your browser and go to [localhost](http://localhost:8000).

### Production Deployment

For the production deployment of this project, I used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). Follow the steps below in order to deploy your own:

1. The first step is I think the most important of all. That is to make sure that in the settings.py on the server folder. The DEBUG is set to False.
2. Create a requirements.txt file using the snippet below:

    ```python
    $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create a Procfile using the terminal.

    ```python
    $ echo web: gunicorn server.wsgi:application
    ```
4. Add changes to git and push it to your preferred branch.

    ```python
    $ git add . 
    $ git commit -m "deploy to heroku"
    $ git push
    ```

5. Go to your Heroku's dashboard and select new button at the very top right of the page. Select create new app and fill out the fields required.

6. Add the following environment variables to the settings section.
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY=<Your own secret key>
    SENDGRID_KEY=<API key created from sendgrid>
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<Stripe secret key>
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS access key>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS secret access key>
    CLIENTS_EMAIL=<site owner's preferred email>
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 # essential to prevent Heroku from uloading static files
    ```

7. Click the configure add-ons and on the search field, type in Heroku Postgres.

8. Apply the migrations to this new database. Note that DEBUG on the settings.py must be set to False

    ```python
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
9. Create an account with an admin permission.

    ```python
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```


10. Go to the deploy section on your Heroku dashboard and then deploy the application.
